# My neovim configs

## Shortcuts I need to remember

Most of my shortcuts are easy to find in [keybindings.lua], but many plugins ship defaults that I keep forgetting (at least until I use them more).

### Folding

- `<leader>za` - toggle fold on current block
- `<leader>zm` - collapse all folds
- `<leader>zr` - expand all folds

### Commenting

- `gcc` - comment line (I could remap this to Ctrl+/ like vscode)
- `gc<down>` - comment this line to the next
- `3gc<down>` - comment this and the next two lines
- `gc` in visial mode - comment selected lines (could also remap this to Ctrl+/ like vscode)
